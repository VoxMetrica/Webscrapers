The code is still messy, but in breif the jupyter notebook runs a selenium programme to grab stock data from LSE stock charts, whereas the py files fit into a scrapy dataframe (running them outside a scrapy framework does not do anything) that gathers fundamental stock data (e.g. p/e ration, market cap, etc.)
